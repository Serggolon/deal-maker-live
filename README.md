# DealMaker Investment Dashboard Scenario

DealMaker is building a new investment dashboard for our clients. This dashboard will display key metrics related to their investments, including:

* **Total Portfolio Value:** The current value of all investments.
* **Investment Growth:** The percentage change in portfolio value since the initial investment.
* **Top Performing Investments:** A list of the top 3 investments with the highest growth rates.

### Technical Requirements

You will be provided with a basic HTML structure and a JSON object containing investment data. Your task is to:

1. **Build a Svelte/React Component:** Create a component that dynamically renders the investment dashboard, displaying the data from the provided JSON object.
2. **Implement API Calls (Mock):** You will need to make API calls to fetch the data. For this screen, you can use a mock API (e.g., using `fetch`) that returns the provided JSON data.
3. **Styling:** Apply basic styling to the dashboard using CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS). Focus on clear, readable information and a visually appealing layout.
4. **Data Visualization (Optional):** Consider using a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to visualize the investment growth percentage in a bar chart or other relevant chart. This will demonstrate additional skills.

### Provided Materials

* **HTML Structure:** A basic HTML file with a `<div>` container for your application and components. This can be found in `index.html`.
* **JavaScript Entrypoint:** A basic JavaScript file that serves as the entrypoint for your application. This can be found in `src/app.js`.
* **JSON Data:** A basic dataset of investment information. This can be found in `src/data.json`.

### Evaluation Criteria

* **Problem Solving (Domain knowledge):** Demonstrate understanding of Svelte components, API calls, and data visualization techniques.
* **Managing Ambiguity:** Effectively handle the mock API calls and apply logic to calculate portfolio value and growth. Identify any potential limitations or assumptions.
* **Communication Skills:** Clearly communicate your thought process, assumptions, and any potential challenges encountered.

### Tips for Candidates

* **Time Management:** Start with the core functionalities (rendering data, API calls) and then focus on styling and data visualization if time permits.
* **Code Clarity:** Write clean and well-commented code that is easy to understand.
* **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to clarify any ambiguities or ask questions if needed.
* **Show Your Work:** Explain your solution steps and reasoning, demonstrating your thought process.
